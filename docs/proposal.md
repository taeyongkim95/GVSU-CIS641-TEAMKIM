# Introduction

An automobile configurator built on the Unity Engine.

# Anticipated Technologies

* Unity Engine
* VS Studio
* Blender (if I have to to edit some of the models)
# Method/Approach

* Acquire free graphical assets to use for the project (Car model with sufficient fidelity and parts breakdown, objects for racetrack)
* Develop configuration system, Test
* Develop driving system, Test
* Make test builds

# Estimated Timeline

* Acquiring assets = 1 week
* Developing Configuration System = 3+ weeks
* Developing Driving System = 2+ weeks
* Final testing and build = 1 week

# Anticipated Problems

* Having trouble finding free assets with good enough quality in terms of graphics fidelity and layer breakdown for customization
* Development challenges for customization portion
* Performance of final product with all the assets in place
