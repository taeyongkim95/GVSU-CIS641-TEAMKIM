# Overview

The purpose of this document is to lay out the different Functional and Non-Functional Requirements of the term project. This will aid in nailing down the key requirements of the end product as well as important characteristics that must be considered during development and planning.

# Functional Requirements

1. Car Configuration Phase
1.1 The car's color shall be configurable using swatches on the UI Hud.
1.2 The car’s seat material shall be configurable using swatches on the UI Hud.
1.3 The configurator’s camera shall be controllable using the mouse controls.
1.4 The car’s total price shall be calculated and displayed on the UI Hud.
1.5 The user shall be able to simulate a “Purchase” of the configured car.

2. Test Drive Phase
2.1 The car shall be drivable during the “Test Drive” phase that the user can choose to start.

3. General Funcionalities
3.1 The user shall be able to go back and forth from the “Configuration” phase to the “Test Drive” phase.

# Non-Functional Requirements

1. Operational Requirements
1.1 The software shall perform its features without crashing.
1.2 The software shall be deployed either in a WebGL format or a separate executable (TBD).

2. Performance Requirements
2.1 The software shall run at a steady FPS (frames-per-second).
2.2 The software shall apply its changes in less than 2 seconds.
2.3 The transition between different “phases” in the software shall happen in less than 3 seconds.
